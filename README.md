First landing page project from The Odin Project. Will also use this as my Solo Project for Chingu.

Skills that will be used in this project include, html, css, flexbox, terminal, git, github, minimal javascript & lottiefiles. 

The function of the landing page is to share information on running animations on websites like showing people where to click, view content, draw attention etc. 

Major function is viewing content only. 

Built using VSCode & Lottie Files and shared with GitHib Pages. 

Deployed on GitHub Pages.
